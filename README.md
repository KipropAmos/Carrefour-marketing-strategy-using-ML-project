  Part 4 Anomaly Detection

### Dimensionality Reduction 

This section of the project entails reducing the dataset to a low dimensional dataset using the FAMD(Factor analysis for mixed data). It also contains the insgights gained from the study.

### Feature selection
This section entails feature selection by employing two techniques: Filter and Embedded Methods.

Feature selection and Dimensionality reduction was done in one R markdown and published. The link to the

### Association Rules

These section entailed identifying relationships between variables in the transactions dataset of the supermarket and the insgights obtained from this analysis

### Anomally Detection

These section entailed studying the sales data of the supermarket over a period of time in an attempt to pinpoint possible fradulent transactions in the supermarket.
and the insgights obtained from this analysis
